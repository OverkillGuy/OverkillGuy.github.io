			<p><em>Who am I?</em></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m Jean-Baptiste Doyon, but everyone calls me Jb (sounds like &ldquo;G-Bay&rdquo; in
French). Across many misinterpretations, it evolved into the online handle Jiby
(my French friends make it sound like the English initialism for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gb">Great
Britain</a>), giving the domain name of this website.</p>

<p>While I&rsquo;m natively French, originally from a town near Nice, I moved across
Europe a few times for my studies before settling in Edinburgh, Scotland.</p>

<p>My background is in Computer Science, with a major in medical image processing.
I&rsquo;m working on backend software development on Linux, and am happy doing a lot
of systems administration and build automation (some call it devops).</p>

<p>Most of my work is spent in the terminal, using <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> (but respect <code>vim</code>). I try
to <a href="https://orgmode.org/">live my life in plain text</a>, and read manuals so others don&rsquo;t have to.</p>

<p>I am on a lifelong journey to get away from cloud systems (think of it as
&ldquo;de-google-ification&rdquo;), both for learning purposes and due to personal beliefs
about <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-intro.en.html">Free Software</a>. I like to call this a &ldquo;selfhosted effort&rdquo; (trying to
self-host as much of my personal infrastructure as possible), which prompts me to title this blog &ldquo;my toolbox&rdquo;.</p>

<p>My motivation for starting this website was to give back to the community, and
hope to convey technical concepts, small tricks and stray thoughts. Mostly
things I&rsquo;ve repeated enough times to write down. But also ideas that I couldn&rsquo;t
find written anywhere else, and have foolishly decided were original.</p>

<p>I would love to hear feedback about this site&rsquo;s content. One can reach me by
email by <strong>replacing the words before the @ with &ldquo;blog&rdquo; in the following address</strong>:
<a href="mailto:blackhole@jb.jiby.tech">blackhole@jb.jiby.tech</a>. Email sent to the wrong address (with &ldquo;blackhole&rdquo;
prefix) will be thrown into the sun (blackholed). This charade game is meant to
avoid spam&hellip; We&rsquo;ll see how effective that is.</p>
