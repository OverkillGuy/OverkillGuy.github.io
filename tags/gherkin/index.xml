      <description>In the previous post, I showed how Gherkin Scenarios provide a great framework for acceptance test definition. I also showed how the dreams of the BDD movement extend to automating Gherkin, using a tool called Cucumber, enforcing traceability of acceptance tests.
In this article, I want to explain my disilusionment towards Cucumber, and show how a low-tech alternative emerged that I believe covers most of the value for none of the effort.</description>

      <description>In the previous post in this series on Gherkin, I showed the tools that Gherkin Features provide for requirements tracking, and mentioned ambitious goals for the Behaviour-driven Development (BDD) movement. In this article, I want to expand on these BDD ideals, show Gherkin Scenarios, and explain how the dream of traceability led to Cucumber, a tool for automating acceptance test execution, tracing them back to Gherkin Scenarios. We&amp;rsquo;ll set aside my personal feelings on these tools for a future post.</description>

      <description>The most common mistake I see developers make is building the wrong thing: Not tracking exactly what is required from the start, and instead getting excited about the cool technical problems ahead. Fast forward a few days, weeks, months, showcasing the product near completion, suddenly the rift between what&amp;rsquo;s needed and what was built becomes obvious, in a frenzy of last minute changes to reach the original goal under pressure from deadlines.</description>
