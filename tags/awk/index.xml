      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s how attempting to export images off a Word Document led to a quest for data deduplication and classification using the shell.
The images I wanted to export were MS Word diagrams drawn in Word, rather than PNG files1. Because those doodle-shapes do not export to PNG well, I first copy-pasted them into Powerpoint to get the familiar &amp;ldquo;save as picture&amp;rdquo; context menu. But a couple of images were still deformed beyond recognition.</description>

      <description>I was trying to convert bank-issued CSV files that have a weird data layout, for automatic processing by the excellent ledger. This made me learn a new thing about awk. Follow me down the UNIXy goodness!
The data I was getting looks like this:
Transaction Date,Transaction Description,Debit Amount,Credit Amount,Balance 29/02/2018,Restaurant,14.5,,1234.2 12/03/2018,ATM withdrawal,50,,1184.2 23/04/2018,Deposited check,,100,1284.2 Note the last line having 100 in a different column: The problem is that, when receiving money, the transaction is logged in a separate entry (&amp;ldquo;Credit Amount&amp;rdquo;) than the (more common) case of debit, which goes to &amp;ldquo;Debit Amount&amp;rdquo; column.</description>
