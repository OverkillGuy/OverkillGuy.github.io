      <description>Every now and then, at work, I find myself discussing git worfklows, commit messages, branching, releasing, versioning, changelogs etc. Since my opinion has remained fairly consistent for the past few years, I found myself repeating the same points a lot, so I wrote it down. This page is the resulting compilation of my opinions on the software development lifecycle (SDLC), without workplace-specific tangeants.
The article is broken down into ideas + recommendations, with recommendations in bold.</description>

      <description>In order to troubleshoot a bug in the very early history of a project using git, I needed a way to show the git diff from &amp;ldquo;nothing&amp;rdquo; to the first commit. Since git keeps a linked graph of commits, what I wanted was a diff from the commit before the first one. Searching the onlines dug up this answer on StackOverflow, showing that there&amp;rsquo;s a specific commit hash we can use to diff from &amp;ldquo;nothing&amp;rdquo; to the first commit:</description>

      <description>When writing long sentences in documentation repositories, git tends to show really unhelpful diffs. They are unreadable because long lines aren&amp;rsquo;t broken, which hides edits happening towards end of line. A colleague of mine asked me if git couldn&amp;rsquo;t be configured to make this sort of thing more obvious. Challenge accepted!
 Figure 1: Can you spot the edit made in a long line of text?
  Kaushal Modi&amp;rsquo;s blog post on git diff for minified JS and CSS inspired this idea for all you prose lovers.</description>
