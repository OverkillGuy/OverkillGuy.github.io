      <description>The most boring part of setting up a new code project is typing the boilerplate: it&amp;rsquo;s easy to forget bits, so we just copy the last project&amp;rsquo;s folder and &amp;ldquo;file the serial numbers off&amp;rdquo; on the project name.
Copy-pasta-driven project setup is not great though, as it&amp;rsquo;s too easy to forget replacing values in obscure files, or misunderstand why project is set up that way in the first place, leading to nasty surprises down the line.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently written a series of articles about Gherkin: its usage for requirements gathering, about its uses in BDD, and a lower-tech alternative to Cucumber, which I&amp;rsquo;m still experimenting with.
I wanted to showcase all of these ideas brought together, as well as show how comfy modern Python tooling can be. But more than writing code, I would need to explain my reasoning as we draft the program. So I picked up again a tool I always wanted to play with: Literate Programming.</description>
