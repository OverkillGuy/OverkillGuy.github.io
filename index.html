					<span class="description">
						
						Every now and then, at work, I find myself discussing git worfklows, commit messages, branching, releasing, versioning, changelogs etc. Since my opinion has remained fairly consistent for the past few years, I found myself repeating the same points a lot, so I wrote it down. This page is the resulting compilation of my opinions on the software development lifecycle (SDLC), without workplace-specific tangeants.
The article is broken down into ideas + recommendations, with recommendations in bold.&hellip;

						The most boring part of setting up a new code project is typing the boilerplate: it&rsquo;s easy to forget bits, so we just copy the last project&rsquo;s folder and &ldquo;file the serial numbers off&rdquo; on the project name.
Copy-pasta-driven project setup is not great though, as it&rsquo;s too easy to forget replacing values in obscure files, or misunderstand why project is set up that way in the first place, leading to nasty surprises down the line.&hellip;

					<span class="description">
						
						Last Friday, I performed a presentation to my colleagues about Makefiles, and I want to share it to the public.
Of note, this presentation is setting aside what people usually know of Makefiles (autoconf-generated blobs, opaque to any inspection because machine-created), and instead I introduce the concept of file transformation as a graph, then teach Makefiles basics (using SQL commands as an example). We then move on to my plea for simple Makefiles, and their potential for both documentation (explain what your codebase commands are, to the juniors), and as lightweight automation (avoid typing long boring commands).&hellip;

						I&rsquo;ve recently written a series of articles about Gherkin: its usage for requirements gathering, about its uses in BDD, and a lower-tech alternative to Cucumber, which I&rsquo;m still experimenting with.
I wanted to showcase all of these ideas brought together, as well as show how comfy modern Python tooling can be. But more than writing code, I would need to explain my reasoning as we draft the program. So I picked up again a tool I always wanted to play with: Literate Programming.&hellip;

						Let&rsquo;s explore how a file-format design exercise turned into reinventing the wheel, and let&rsquo;s all appreciate how lucky we are that the protocols that the internet are built on have fantastic public documents called RFCs.
Designing a file format I was idly thinking about designing a good binary file format for a side project of mine called qrxfil. The project aims at QR-code-based file export: split a file in many pieces (based on content limit of QR codes) before reassembling it on the other side.&hellip;

						In the previous post, I showed how Gherkin Scenarios provide a great framework for acceptance test definition. I also showed how the dreams of the BDD movement extend to automating Gherkin, using a tool called Cucumber, enforcing traceability of acceptance tests.
In this article, I want to explain my disilusionment towards Cucumber, and show how a low-tech alternative emerged that I believe covers most of the value for none of the effort.&hellip;

					<span class="description">
						
						In the previous post in this series on Gherkin, I showed the tools that Gherkin Features provide for requirements tracking, and mentioned ambitious goals for the Behaviour-driven Development (BDD) movement. In this article, I want to expand on these BDD ideals, show Gherkin Scenarios, and explain how the dream of traceability led to Cucumber, a tool for automating acceptance test execution, tracing them back to Gherkin Scenarios. We&rsquo;ll set aside my personal feelings on these tools for a future post.&hellip;

						The most common mistake I see developers make is building the wrong thing: Not tracking exactly what is required from the start, and instead getting excited about the cool technical problems ahead. Fast forward a few days, weeks, months, showcasing the product near completion, suddenly the rift between what&rsquo;s needed and what was built becomes obvious, in a frenzy of last minute changes to reach the original goal under pressure from deadlines.&hellip;

						Here&rsquo;s how attempting to export images off a Word Document led to a quest for data deduplication and classification using the shell.
The images I wanted to export were MS Word diagrams drawn in Word, rather than PNG files1. Because those doodle-shapes do not export to PNG well, I first copy-pasted them into Powerpoint to get the familiar &ldquo;save as picture&rdquo; context menu. But a couple of images were still deformed beyond recognition.&hellip;

						Like many developers, I keep track of my configuration files in version control, to make moving to new machines is simpler and share code with others. This process started out for my Emacs config files at first, but grew to consume other aspects: bash functions, git aliases&hellip; Since 2016, I have accumulated over 500 git commits.
Now the dotfiles are tracked, the next biggest pain is to install packages and folder structures and obscure commands required to set up some subsystems needs which config files.&hellip;
