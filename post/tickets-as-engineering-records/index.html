<p>In the software world, tickets (as implemented in Jira, etc) often have a bad
reputation, and I think it&rsquo;s undeserved, once we reframe what, or who tickets
are <em>for</em>.</p>

<p>In this article I want to revisit the purpose of tickets, usually &ldquo;tickets for
project management&rdquo;, explore an alternative viewpoint of &ldquo;tickets as engineering
records&rdquo;, and highlight how tickets should be useable as asynchronous
alternative to (synchronous) communication.</p>

<h2 id="tickets-as-project-management">Tickets as project management</h2>

<p>Under this fairly common viewpoint, tickets are a project manager&rsquo;s tool, almost
inflicted upon devs, likely in an attempt to punish them for their arcane powers
over machine, who knows (I&rsquo;m of course exaggerating on purpose).</p>

<p>Under this interpretation, tickets are not <em>really</em> useful to developers much,
but instead the closest thing to electronic bracelets, like clock-in clock-out
punch-cards, but for morsels of work: Work is directed to you via tickets
assignment, you do the work, you move it to completion and that&rsquo;s all there is
to it.</p>

<p>I find this an unproductive viewpoint, needlessly adversarial, reeking of
&ldquo;Managers are evil and want only to make their graphs (of KPIs) look good&rdquo;. In
that mindset, engineers are the good guys, trying to do their work, but are held
back by paperwork and the ticket-bureaucracy. How unfair!</p>

<h2 id="tickets-as-engineering-records">Tickets as engineering records</h2>

<p>I found much more productive to reframe ticket use by looking at pure
bug-trackers, such as Debian&rsquo;s bugzilla: Pick a random bug, notice it tells a
story of the issue, of who spotted it, how to reproduce, and looking at the
comments over time, we see the mystery get investigated, hopefully resolved as
supporting elements are introduced, example and counter-examples found, etc.</p>

<p>These bug trackers use tickets as an engineer&rsquo;s record of what happened during
the investigation, and even when a bug is long closed, it may still be useful to
revisit it: to learn what the original issue was, how it was found out, how it
was fixed, what other solutions were considered but dismissed and why.</p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s think of tickets for new features, or bugs, to be just like engineering
records for the future: Let&rsquo;s make sure that the design decisions are recorded
when they occur, especially the kind of twist and turns that occur during
exploration, and that may answer future questions.</p>

<p>A good engineering ticket can be, just like a good git commit, revisited 2
(or 10) years later, reading about the decisions (the ones that aren&rsquo;t already
recorded in architectural/design documents), seeing for instance why this
library was chosen when another one looked just as mature. Perhaps the ticket
shows one library wasn&rsquo;t supporting the encryption mode we needed, or a
compatibility issue with language feature was found, but this was fixed since
then. Perhaps the performance constraint that required going one way is no
longer relevant. I like to imagine a good engineering ticket like going into
<code>git bisect</code>.</p>

<h2 id="tickets-as-async-status-update">Tickets as async status update</h2>

<p>Ticket comments work best as status log, updated asynchronously on your own time
as work progresses. Every so often, someone will be asking me &ldquo;how close to done
is this ticket?&rdquo; over chat, or even face to face. By chat, I most of the time
end up copying the latest update from the ticket, something like &ldquo;Feature
implemented in PR 123, will start integration-test with branch XYZ tomorrow,
expect it to be reviewable by Tuesday; need to get Amy to prep the integration
environment&rdquo;<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:fn-1"><a href="#fn:fn-1">1</a></sup>. So, why interrupt me, <em>synchronously</em>,
only to get data that can be gotten asynchronously from the ticket, ticket which
is <em>supposed to be</em> the primary source of this information anyway?</p>

<p>I believe good ticket hygiene means there&rsquo;s frequent updates as comments on
ticket, just like for incidents: The best place to get the freshest update, is
not to bother me directly, but to subscribe to the ticket&rsquo;s update feed. This
scales, when direct messaging won&rsquo;t.</p>

<h2 id="tickets-as-business-continuity-tool">Tickets as business continuity tool</h2>

<p>As work is being selected into sprint, I like to think that a good ticket
contains enough context so anyone qualified can pick up the full work, and have
all the arcana documented (like odd requirements, known issues to look out for,
half-ready code to dust out, or red herrings and traps in the codebase&hellip;).</p>

<p>In that sense, the ticket works as business continuity insurance, where the
original reporter can become suddenly unavailable, but the work can carry on
with no measurable interruptions.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve even heard of a team where the original ticket reporter is not <em>allowed</em> to
talk about the ticket during backlog review activity, or any planning poker. I
find that a brilliant solution to force the context to be written up. I&rsquo;ve even
heard reports from that team that this practice encouraged juniors to pick up
harder work, because there was no more hidden knowledge assumed.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I personally believe that a good ticket practice makes codebases survive longer,
with less friction. Just like good git commit messages help investigate
years-old decisions, the tickets are a crucial part of the institutional memory
of a project, when people may not still be there to tell the tale.</p>

<p>But this assumes that we&rsquo;re using tickets not as a burden, but as a detailed
history of the implementation of a project, down to every attempts and missteps of the project.</p>

<p>Despite the commit messages, and design documents, which carry most of the
&ldquo;public history&rdquo; across, we sometimes need to see that day-by-day activity
recounted, the in-the-dark sausage making details, to shine a light on a problem
or decision that is still impacting us down the line, but may not have felt
critical to write in a decision record.</p>

<p>But this assumes a rigorous practice of logging often, and in a way that people
without any timezone overlap can fully track progress and contribute. That part
is important to foster for a healthy remote culture.</p>

<p>In many of these discussions, I lean towards strong self-imposed discipline,
which is not something that can be imposed from outside. I&rsquo;ve also found, as my
career trended towards more operational areas, that the imperatives of quick
turnaround clash quite heavily with these ideals, forcing me to re-evaluate.
Certainly a point to revisit in the future!</p>

<li id="fn:fn-1"><p>Notice this format is close to a &ldquo;CAN report&rdquo;, which is in
heavy use in the firefighting community. From a <a href="https://www.fireengineering.com/firefighter-training/drill-of-the-week-the-can-report-1/">firefighting website</a>: &ldquo;An easy
way to answer or transmit a progress report is the CAN report. The C A N report
stands for Conditions, Actions, Needs. By using this order model, the person
giving the report easily identifies how well they are doing, the conditions they
are facing, and any support or resource needs that they have.&rdquo; I love learning
about my job from looking at others!</p>
