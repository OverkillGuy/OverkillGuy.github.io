<p>In the previous post, I showed how Gherkin Scenarios provide a great framework
for acceptance test definition. I also showed how the dreams of the BDD movement
extend to automating Gherkin, using a tool called Cucumber, enforcing
traceability of acceptance tests.</p>

<p>In this article, I want to explain my disilusionment towards Cucumber, and show
how a low-tech alternative emerged that I believe covers most of the value
for none of the effort.</p>

<h2 id="cucumber-fatigue">Cucumber fatigue</h2>

<p>Cucumber is originally a Ruby tool, but I primarily write Python these days.
Though there exists tooling to hook Ruby&rsquo;s Cucumber in other languages, the most
convenient tooling for me were the Python rewrites: The elderly <a href="https://behave.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Behave</a>, the
defunct <a href="https://pypi.org/project/lettuce/">lettuce</a>, and more recently, the nobly-backed <a href="https://pytest-bdd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">pytest-bdd</a>, of Pytest
workgroup fame.</p>

<p>At one time or another, I ended up testing all of them on personal projects, to
experiment with how cool BDD is in practice, I was a big Gherkin fan already. I
don&rsquo;t remember much about playing with the tools, as this was over ten years ago
now. But I do remember coming out disappointed, like the tooling didn&rsquo;t deliver
on the promise of BDD.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll try to break down why I felt this.</p>

<h3 id="pytest-framework-is-just-too-good">Pytest framework is just too good</h3>

<p>Having worked with the fantastic <a href="https://pytest.org">pytest</a>, the framework is really natural,
convenient: Each function is a standalone test, with reusable fixtures providing
flexibility for setup and teardown.</p>

<p>Compared to that, the Given/When/Then tests in Cucumber force us to split code
into three or more functions. Tests are thus harder to read, as we need to jump
between functions to see what trigger ran before this assert error, but there&rsquo;s
hardly a trace to follow in the execution stack (as steps are run sequentially,
not recursively. By the time we get to an assert error, the precondition or
trigger has been executed, and backtrace is empty of it).</p>

<h3 id="cucumber-test-code-reuse-is-hard">Cucumber test code reuse is hard</h3>

<p>Code reuse inside tests is hard enough as it is, but Cucumber encourages reuse
of Given-s implementation across tests as the most supreme form of BDD. So two
Gherkin Features that happen to have the same pre-conditional Given, should use
the same Given setup function in Cucumber&hellip; Except I never managed to do it.</p>

<p>Tests in a typical projects have multiple layers, so a Feature&rsquo;s Given becomes a
full Scenario below, how do we reuse the fixture code then?</p>

<p>Similarly, a chains of events (say a sequence of 5 message events that must
happen in order) are very hard to write Gherkin about, because each event in
the chain is an assert (Then), but also a trigger for the next one (Given).
Writing Cucumber code to match this becomes tedious.</p>

<p>So Gherkin step code reuse, the &ldquo;pinnacle of BDD&rdquo;, was a bust for me. For most
of these I ended up writing Pytest-style tests, one test function at a time,
ditching Cucumber.</p>

<h3 id="too-different-from-normal-workflow">Too different from normal workflow</h3>

<p>The Cucumber technique of writing tests is a major break from conventional test
practices, so big a change that I don&rsquo;t feel comfortable asking anybody else to
do so in a team project.</p>

<p>So the tooling didn&rsquo;t impress me, the abstraction level felt wrong, and this big
break with well established practice didn&rsquo;t seem justified enough to get
workplaces to adopt it.</p>

<h2 id="where-is-the-value-again">Where is the value, again?</h2>

<p>As a mildly self-aware person, I taught myself to follow a rule: anytime I spend half an
hour deep-diving in a problem, I must take a step back, and ask &ldquo;Why am I doing
this?&ldquo;, and followup questions, like &ldquo;Is the problem as stated worth solving?&rdquo;
&ldquo;What long-term goal is this short-term hell solving?&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Most of the time, the answer is &ldquo;actually I don&rsquo;t need to solve this, not
exactly&rdquo;, and I find some way to side-step the issue altogether. Or convince
myself it wasn&rsquo;t worth even trying this and just abandon the line of inquiry.</p>

<p>So, what are we really doing here, trying to crowbar this Cucumber tool inside
the testing workflow!?</p>

<p>Well, as we saw before, gathering requirements was important enough to write
nice Gherkin Features about. And now we would like to prove that we indeed have
100% coverage of the Features via acceptance tests. That&rsquo;s a boolean answer: all
features covered, or missing tests. And on top of that, we want traceability:
which test covers which feature.</p>

<p>But is Cucumber necessary for this? Really?</p>

<p>Surveying my thoughts, I still enjoyed weaving Scenarios within conventional
test functions, I just didn&rsquo;t want to have to do anything drastic to the test
code. So I evolved a technique that can be seen as a natural middle ground.</p>

<h2 id="low-tech-gherkin-inside-test-comments">Low tech Gherkin inside test comments</h2>

<p>Going back to my Pytest code, I found myself still writing new tests with
Gherkin Scenarios, but inserting it in code comments. I found the Gherkin helps
me reason about the tests, but the comments nature avoids any tooling
interference.</p>

<p>The Gherkin is purely comments for the reader, and I love it. No tooling in the
way. But soon my tests grow to multiple pages of code, and I wanted to get a
bird&rsquo;s eye view of my tests&rsquo; scenarios, to know what test to write next.</p>

<h2 id="accidental-automation">Accidental automation</h2>

<p>I noticed that the markup syntax I had landed on was pretty regular &hellip; like,
regular-expression kind of regular. So I experimented with a quick grep command
on a given file, extracting all the Gherkin Keywords.</p>

<p>I keep using this script to date, and started encouraging others to adopt the
pattern of commenting, shared the little script with my team at work.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I explained how the noble Dream of Cucumber tooling seems to fall short, not
delivering all the value it promised. I showed also how this dream was
rekindled, by aiming lower: a simple comment-based markup in code. And again,
such joy at finding that small, incremental amounts of automation add value in a
low-tech fashion.</p>

<p>I believe this simple solution for Gherkin really captures over 80% of the value of
Gherkin Scenarios usage in BDD frameworks, while being less than 20% of the effort
of &ldquo;proper tools&rdquo; like Cucumber, with none the drawbacks outlined above.</p>

<p>I do believe that the markup approach I grew here hasn&rsquo;t reached its full
potential, and will keep experimenting with this format. I think there&rsquo;s an
opportunity to build some tooling that leverage the comments for traceability
like Cucumber does. If I succeed at building tools that still feel
lightweight, you can be sure to I&rsquo;ll post about it on this blog.</p>

<p>This is the end of my planned series of articles on Gherkin and BDD, join
me in the next post, where I&rsquo;ll demonstrate all we just talked about through a
toy project.</p>
