<p><strong>The most common mistake I see developers make is building the wrong thing</strong>: Not
tracking exactly what is required from the start, and instead getting excited
about the cool technical problems ahead. Fast forward a few days, weeks, months,
showcasing the product near completion, suddenly the rift between what&rsquo;s needed
and what was built becomes obvious, in a frenzy of last minute changes to reach
the original goal under pressure from deadlines.</p>

<p>Developers need to get into the habit of questioning every new feature request,
sort of like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five%5Fwhys">Five Whys</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;<em>What</em> are we building?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;<em>Why</em> are we building this?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Do we <em>need</em> it?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;<em>Who</em> needs it?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;<em>Why</em> do they need it?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Do they need it <em>now</em>?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Do they need it built <em>that way</em>?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<p>Often, the answers invalidate the need for the feature, be it because of
scheduling: &ldquo;Actually, partners won&rsquo;t be able to connect to our platform until
next year, so we can probably hold off on building the API for now.&rdquo; or more
aggressively by shouting &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You%5Faren%27t%5Fgonna%5Fneed%5Fit">YAGNI</a>!&rdquo; from rooftops like a ninja out to cut down
on scope creep.</p>

<p>Either way, the problem is that the user&rsquo;s demands (requirements) aren&rsquo;t clearly
written down, leading to technical proposals that don&rsquo;t match what&rsquo;s needed.</p>

<p>To bridge that gap of requirements traceability, we need a way to describe what
features are needed and what value they add to the product. This is often called
&ldquo;user stories&rdquo;, and can be a fantastic tool to clarify a product.</p>

<p>In this article, the first in a series on Gherkin, I propose that, by <strong>writing
up user stories in Gherkin</strong>, you get <strong>a clear view of your software&rsquo;s
requirements and specifications</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="requirements-101">Requirements 101</h2>

<p>Usually a project starts with a customer wanting something built. To build it,
the customer sends a pile of money, and a list of demands, called the <span class="underline">user
requirements</span>. Some of these requirements are <span class="underline">functional</span>, when they describe
actual features, but usually come along with some notes about what a good
solution looks like: (&ldquo;it must take less than a second to gather all data&rdquo;, or
&ldquo;it must run locally, not in the cloud&rdquo;), called <span class="underline">non-functional requirements</span>
because they&rsquo;re not new features, just properties of a valid solution.</p>

<p>Whatever is built needs to tick all the user requirements, which means
implementing all the requested features, but also validate the non-functional
aspects.</p>

<p>The exercise of building a system while tracking which built features map to
which source requirement, in order to build exactly what was needed and no more,
is usually quite tedious, can involve spreadsheets, traceability matrices, and
other torture devices. Surely there is a simpler way to get most of that value?</p>

<h2 id="enters-gherkin">Enters Gherkin</h2>

<p><a href="https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/">Gherkin</a> is a restricted subset of English that allows plain text specification
of user stories. We&rsquo;ll limit our interest to Gherkin <code>Features</code> for now, but
it should be noted there&rsquo;s an entire software movement involving Gherkin for
traceability from requirement to acceptance tests, called <a href="https://cucumber.io/docs/bdd/">Behaviour-driven
Development</a>, which I&rsquo;ll cover in more detail another time.</p>

<p><a id="code-snippet--requirement-feature"></a></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#93a1a1;background-color:#002b36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-feature" data-lang="feature"><span style="color:#719e07">Feature:</span><span style="color:#268bd2"> Event signup
</span><span style="color:#268bd2">  As an event organiser
</span><span style="color:#268bd2">  I need users to sign up ahead of an event
</span><span style="color:#268bd2">  In order to approximate event size for booking accomodation</span></code></pre></div>

  <span class="src-block-number"><a href="#code-snippet--requirement-feature">Code Snippet 1</a></span>:
  A Gherkin Feature file, inspired by a Discord bot I recently dug into
</div>

<p>In a few specific lines, we captured everything we need to know about this: what
is needed, who needs it, and why. It&rsquo;s also remarkably close to what a
conversation with a customer might provide. This simplicity is part of the value
of Gherkin<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:fn-1"><a href="#fn:fn-1">1</a></sup>. Let&rsquo;s break it down:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Feature: ...</code>: the feature&rsquo;s title (as would appear in a bug tracker)</li>
<li><code>As a ...</code> tells us who <em>cares</em> about this feature (in UML Usecase diagrams, this is called the Actor)</li>
<li><code>I need ...</code>: a one line description of the feature</li>
<li><code>In order to ...</code> (or <code>So that ...</code>) explains why is this important (priorization, grouping requirements together)</li>
</ul>

<p>Imagine if every high level feature request of a project was documented in such
a way, with simple explanation of what&rsquo;s needed, by whom, and why!</p>

<p>In particular, this format solves a classic issue: sometimes customers know what
they want (&ldquo;In order to&rdquo;) but their proposed feature (&ldquo;I need&rdquo;) isn&rsquo;t quite the
best way to achieve this. This is common enough to have a name, the <a href="https://xyproblem.info/">XY problem</a>.</p>

<h2 id="requirements-specification-drilling-down">Requirements, specification: drilling down</h2>

<p>Back to project management: with user requirements in hand, software design can
proceed, and Specification begins. Specifications are technical
decisions made in order to achieve the required goal.</p>

<p>Specifications can also be written as Gherkin features, they just also happen to
encode a design choice about the way to implement the requirement. Remember to
question &ldquo;is this so-called Feature relying on a design decision?&rdquo;.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#93a1a1;background-color:#002b36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-feature" data-lang="feature"><span style="color:#719e07">Feature:</span><span style="color:#268bd2"> Discord emoji-reactions event signup
</span><span style="color:#268bd2">  As an event organiser
</span><span style="color:#268bd2">  I need users to respond to event invitation via emoji reactions on discord
</span><span style="color:#268bd2">  In order to get projected attendance numbers</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="src-block-caption">
  <span class="src-block-number">Code Snippet 2</span>:
  Note how this feature references Discord, but could have specified "email" instead. This hints it is probably a specification (technical decision), which is a specific strategy to implement a user requirement.
</div>

<p>Such a common format for both requirements and specification allows one to drill
down into implementation specifics, just be careful to not mix up abstraction
levels: Gathering all requirements into one place, where a project overview can
be kept is still the most valuable application of Gherkin Features, everything
else is secondary.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s it! When you next want to list out all the functional user
requirements of a project, just start with a blank document, write out &ldquo;Feature:
&hellip; As a &hellip; I need &hellip; In order to &hellip;&rdquo; and fill in the gaps, adding as many
features as needed. That&rsquo;s enough to get a lot of value, just by asking
questions like &ldquo;Who needs this, again? &hellip; Cool, but why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the next Gherkin article, I&rsquo;ll show how Behaviour-Driven Development workflow
provides tracking of the requirements you just wrote all the way to project
delivery, through the practice of Acceptance Testing, written out as many
Gherkin Scenarios for each Gherkin Feature.</p>

<li id="fn:fn-1">I&rsquo;m taking some liberties as to what the Gherkin syntax defines strictly, for instance the &ldquo;as a &hellip; I need &hellip; In order to&hellip;&rdquo; syntax isn&rsquo;t specified in Gherkin, but it&rsquo;s common enough to show up in some Gherkin snippets/templates.
