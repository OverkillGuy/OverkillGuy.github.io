<p>In the <a href="../../post/gherkin-features-user-requirements/">previous post in this series on Gherkin</a>, I showed the tools that Gherkin
Features provide for requirements tracking, and mentioned ambitious goals for
the Behaviour-driven Development (BDD) movement. In this article, I want to
expand on these BDD ideals, show Gherkin Scenarios, and explain how the dream of
traceability led to Cucumber, a tool for automating acceptance test execution,
tracing them back to Gherkin Scenarios. We&rsquo;ll set aside my personal feelings on
these tools for a future post.</p>

<h2 id="bdd-ideals">BDD ideals</h2>

<p>The behaviour-driven development movement (closely associated with the
Acceptance-Test Driven Development, aka ATDD) believes that customers don&rsquo;t ever
care about (good) code, they care about behaviours: More code does not
matter, unless the result is behaviours useful to the client. This translates to
testing: Who cares about code internals getting 100% test coverage, the point is
what external system behaviour is being flexed, what value is being added to the
project.</p>

<p>This highlights that BDD isn&rsquo;t as much a developer&rsquo;s movement (like TDD is often
portrayed as), it&rsquo;s a vision for project management. We want to make sure we
<em>build the right thing</em>, rather than build software <em>right</em>.</p>

<p>To ensure we build the right thing, BDD tries to bring the 3 amigos<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:fn-1"><a href="#fn:fn-1">1</a></sup> together to spec out behaviours of the project, very
early on, with code being simply a means to get those behaviours.</p>

<p>But then, the ATDD crowd comes in, and points out that &ldquo;all this behaviour you
want &hellip; how do we prove it&rsquo;s correctly implemented? The TDD crowd has a point
you know?&ldquo;.</p>

<p>So the BDD crew thought up a dream of traceability: Specify behaviours ahead of
time, with the product owner, to the point that acceptance tests are written
before any line of code, and have tooling record full traceability of
requirements all the way to project completion via automated tests. When the
automated acceptance tests are green, the product is complete, ready to ship.</p>

<p>This push for tooling to manage requirements as code is in line with similar
movements like infrastructure-as-code, and more recently documentation-as-code.
These movements acknowledge that developers have fantastic tools and processes,
like version control, continuous integration, and code review, and believe that
more parts of the development cycle should align with these practices. First it
was sysadmins and frustratingly irreproducible machines, then documentation
moving away from Word&rsquo;s binary files, and now Gherkin bringing requirements
traceability tooling.</p>

<p>To see how this works out in practice, let&rsquo;s come back to Gherkin, the DSL
(Domain Specific Language) that BDD created to specify behaviours.</p>

<h2 id="gherkin-scenarios">Gherkin Scenarios</h2>

<p>We <a href="../../post/gherkin-features-user-requirements/#enters-gherkin">covered Features</a> before. As you can see, Features aren&rsquo;t tests, they don&rsquo;t
cover edge cases, and aren&rsquo;t sufficient to know precisely what to build.
This is where a new Gherkin construct is useful: Scenarios.</p>

<p>Scenarios (sometimes called Examples) gives us a way to show how behaviour works
as a testable unit, by breaking it down into precondition, trigger, and
outcome.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#93a1a1;background-color:#002b36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-feature" data-lang="feature"><span style="color:#719e07">Scenario:</span><span style="color:#268bd2"> User signs up to an event

</span><span style="color:#268bd2">  </span><span style="color:#719e07">And </span><span style="color:#268bd2">an email reminder is sent to the user</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="src-block-caption">
  <span class="src-block-number">Code Snippet 1</span>:
  Sample Scenario, describing workflow of the Feature of previous post in series
</div>

<p>Breaking it down:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Given</code>: Pre-condition, context the scenario is built around. Any resources
required to make the test happen is defined here.</li>
<li><code>When</code>: Trigger for the specific behaviour being described</li>
<li><code>Then</code>: Outcome of the feature. Must be an externally assertable behaviour, no
prodding object internals</li>
<li><code>And</code>, <code>But</code>: Syntactic sugar to avoid repetition. &ldquo;But&rdquo; is shorthand for &ldquo;And not&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>

<p>Gherkin has more tricks like Scenario Outlines, data tables, Backgrounds, tags
for Feature grouping, but I won&rsquo;t cover them here, you&rsquo;d be better served
reading <a href="https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/">the gherkin reference</a> and then go over <a href="https://github.com/andredesousa/gherkin-best-practices">gherkin best practices</a>. <strong>Suffice to
remember that Gherkin has Features, good for requirements, and Features can be
elaborated into Scenarios to create acceptance tests.</strong></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that Scenarios are hard to write well: the level of
abstraction must be just right: not getting into the weeds of implementation
concerns, but also not too disconnected from technical details, which
often requires a developer to be around. So you can&rsquo;t write these just between
marketing department and the customer, you want a dev.
To capture the behaviours that add the most business value, a product owner is
important here as well. Finally, these must be testable, so a QA member is
valuable &hellip; and so we come back to three amigos in a room.</p>

<h2 id="cucumber-the-dream-of-automating-bdd-traceability">Cucumber: The Dream of automating BDD traceability</h2>

<p>Gherkin-the-syntax was created to serve as english text blueprints for the
specification of acceptance tests. But BDD goes further: we have testing
frameworks, so why not use Gherkin-the-text as a machine-enforced spec of the
system behaviours, with each line of Gherkin Scenario mapping to the actual test
code. This way, the project&rsquo;s progress can be observed by how many acceptance
tests are now green, and how many are still red.</p>

<p>So the tool <a href="https://cucumber.io/docs/guides/overview/#what-is-cucumber">Cucumber</a> was born from the Ruby community, running acceptance tests
by reading Gherkin. Here&rsquo;s an example of this kind of traceability, taken from
<a href="https://pypi.org/project/pytest-bdd/">pytest-bdd</a>, a Python reimplementation of Cucumber built as extension of the
<a href="https://pytest.org/">pytest</a> framework:</p>

<p>As you can see, decorators sprinkled over test code gives a way to link the
tests back to Gherkin, which the tool then uses to report how many behaviours
are validated by acceptance tests. In the case of an &ldquo;all green&rdquo; test report,
the project can be shipped, because all required behaviours have been
implemented.</p>

<p>Note of course that acceptance tests are not unit tests, as acceptance tests
don&rsquo;t say anything about the internal qualities of a codebase, just prove the
external behaviour of it all. So BDD doesn&rsquo;t make good code on its own, because
code maintainability isn&rsquo;t a direct objective of BDD.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>BDD is a software movement that tries to reconciliate all parties of the project
planning around the definition of Behaviours in a clear language, called
Gherkin. It even pushes this dream towards tooling, Cucumber, which enforces
these behaviours through acceptance tests that trace back to Gherkin.
Requirements-as-code is an admirable goal, which I&rsquo;m excited about!</p>

<p>However, as we&rsquo;ll see in a later post, I believe the tooling doesn&rsquo;t quite live
up to the expectations. In the next post on this series on Gherkin, we&rsquo;ll look
at how Cucumber falls flat, and I&rsquo;ll showcase my personal low-tech solution
for grabbing 80% of the value for 20% of the effort.</p>
