			<p>I&rsquo;ve recently written a series of articles about Gherkin: <a href="../gherkin-features-user-requirements/">its usage for
requirements gathering</a>, about <a href="../bdd-dreams-cucumber-and-gherkin/">its uses in BDD</a>, and a <a href="../low-tech-cucumber-replacement/">lower-tech alternative to Cucumber</a>, which I&rsquo;m still experimenting with.</p>

<p>I wanted to showcase all of these ideas brought together, as well as show how
comfy modern Python tooling can be. But more than writing code, I would need to
explain my reasoning as we draft the program. So I picked up again a tool I always
wanted to play with: Literate Programming.</p>

<p>Literate programming is a technique consisting of weaving together code by
writing a story (blogpost to novel-sized), with code snippets embedded in the
story as we think of the design. Specialised tooling exports these code blocks
to their permanent location in the code repository, so that the programming
language&rsquo;s tooling kicks in to build, test, and validate.</p>

<p>Regarding what to program <em>about</em>, I wanted something that was simple enough to
read through in one sitting, but meaty enough to have a couple surprises during
implementation. The opportunity presented itself with the recent viral spread
of Wordle.</p>

<p>So I present you my &ldquo;Literate Wordle&rdquo;, a modern Python codebase written in
literate programming style, using TDD and BDD. Have a look at <a href="https://github.com/OverkillGuy/literate-wordle">the Github
repository literate-wordle</a>, and the rendered version of the docs, on my website
<a href="../../project/literate_wordle/index.html">the pretty version of the project &ldquo;story&rdquo; on my website</a>.</p>

<figure><a href="../../project/literate_wordle/wordle.html">
    <img src="/ox-hugo/wordle.png"
         alt="Figure 1: Click the image to go to the rendered version of project docs" width="100%"/> </a><figcaption>
            <p><span class="figure-number">Figure 1: </span>Click the image to go to the rendered version of project docs</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>Other than being a novella-sized text, the extracted codebase is quite plain and
normal-looking (<a href="https://github.com/OverkillGuy/literate-wordle">as you can see in Github</a>), with just a little bit of automation
done around the documentation generation, so that the <code>features/</code> folder (where
Gherkin Features are) is picked up by the Sphinx docs as Requirements.</p>

<figure><a href="../../project/literate_wordle/_collections/gherkin_feature.html">
    <img src="/ox-hugo/wordle-reqs.png"
         alt="Figure 2: Click the image to view the project requirements" width="100%"/> </a><figcaption>
            <p><span class="figure-number">Figure 2: </span>Click the image to view the project requirements</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>I am excited about ways to augment this project, such as using the implemented
scoring to explore wordle solving: brute-force the scoring function for all
valid inputs, store the results in database, and expose the database as a simple
wordle solver interface: Given you got score &ldquo;ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ¨â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ&rdquo; for guess &ldquo;crane&rdquo;,
these are the possible answers&hellip;</p>

<p>But most importantly, this is a codebase that implements the pattern of Gherkin
in test comments I described in my <a href="../low-tech-cucumber-replacement/">lower-tech alternative to Cucumber</a> article.
The code is sizeable enough that one could meaningfully compare the content of
the <code>features/</code> folder with the <code>show-gherkin()</code> content of the <code>tests/</code> folder.
I&rsquo;m writing tool to automate such a cucumber-like check, and hope to reveal
details on this blog soon.</p>
