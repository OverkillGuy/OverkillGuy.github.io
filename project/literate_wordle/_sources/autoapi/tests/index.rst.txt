:py:mod:`tests`
===============

.. py:module:: tests

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   Tests for literate_wordle.

   By having this init file here, we declare the local folder as a python module. This
   allows imports as the folder's name = "tests".

   This is very useful to put reusable (common across tests) data and fixtures, in a way
   that can be imported cleanly. If we have a file here called "samples.py", we can now do
   "from tests.samples import MY_COMMON_DATA".
