						I was trying to convert bank-issued CSV files that have a weird data layout, for automatic processing by the excellent ledger. This made me learn a new thing about awk. Follow me down the UNIXy goodness!
The data I was getting looks like this:
Transaction Date,Transaction Description,Debit Amount,Credit Amount,Balance 29/02/2018,Restaurant,14.5,,1234.2 12/03/2018,ATM withdrawal,50,,1184.2 23/04/2018,Deposited check,,100,1284.2 Note the last line having 100 in a different column: The problem is that, when receiving money, the transaction is logged in a separate entry (&ldquo;Credit Amount&rdquo;) than the (more common) case of debit, which goes to &ldquo;Debit Amount&rdquo; column.&hellip;

					<a class="title" href="/post/git-diff-empty-repo/">Git diff from empty commit</a> &mdash;
					<span class="description">
						
						In order to troubleshoot a bug in the very early history of a project using git, I needed a way to show the git diff from &ldquo;nothing&rdquo; to the first commit. Since git keeps a linked graph of commits, what I wanted was a diff from the commit before the first one. Searching the onlines dug up this answer on StackOverflow, showing that there&rsquo;s a specific commit hash we can use to diff from &ldquo;nothing&rdquo; to the first commit:&hellip;

					<span class="description">
						
						I&rsquo;m writing code to back up my user data off a website that lets me see all of my info (including querying by time, account etc) but doesn&rsquo;t have export features (officially). I am certain there&rsquo;s an API behind the site that I just have to make sense of.
Since the webapp is requesting data from the API when I click, we should be able to record the web traffic to explore the API.&hellip;

					<a class="title" href="/post/git-diff-lines-prose/">Git diff for prose</a> &mdash;
					<span class="description">
						
						When writing long sentences in documentation repositories, git tends to show really unhelpful diffs. They are unreadable because long lines aren&rsquo;t broken, which hides edits happening towards end of line. A colleague of mine asked me if git couldn&rsquo;t be configured to make this sort of thing more obvious. Challenge accepted!
 Figure 1: Can you spot the edit made in a long line of text?
  Kaushal Modi&rsquo;s blog post on git diff for minified JS and CSS inspired this idea for all you prose lovers.&hellip;

						Get a cool graph of commits from the command line! For newbies and experts alike, git is a bit hard to visualize. Here&rsquo;s a handy git command to make understanding git easier.
git log --decorate --oneline --graph  Figure 1: Git graph of this repository
  This can be made into a git command via an entry your ~/.gitconfig:
[alias] graph = log --decorate --oneline --graph Code Snippet 1: Alias "&hellip;

						Last night, I presented about Termux to EdLug, the Edinburgh Linux User group (see the event page on meetup.com) in a talk titled &ldquo;The freedom of shelling out on Android&rdquo;. It was tons of fun showing off how your Android phone/tablet getting a terminal unlocks a powerful tool!

						Welcome to my website!
This blog is meant to record some of the thoughts I keep coming back to, or discussions I&rsquo;ve had over and over again with different people. My rule of thumb for inclusion here is &ldquo;if you&rsquo;ve had to say it more than twice, it&rsquo;s time to write it down&rdquo;.
See the About page for my background and motivations.
Look forward more posts as I try to condense my thoughts in written form.&hellip;
